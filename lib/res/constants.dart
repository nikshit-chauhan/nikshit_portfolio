    "Hi there! I'm Nikshit, the Co-Founder of Tripixel Labs. My passion lies in crafting stunning and functional mobile applications using Flutter and Firebase. At Tripixel Labs, I’ve spearheaded multiple projects that will soon be available on the Play Store and App Store – stay tuned!\n\nBefore embarking on this entrepreneurial journey, I honed my skills at Sheegr Seafoods and Logistics, where I developed innovative mobile solutions for sustainable and high-quality seafood products and services. My role there allowed me to merge technology with sustainability, making a real impact.\n\nMy adventure in the tech world began at UIPEP Technologies, a dynamic software development company specializing in web and mobile solutions. I collaborated with talented developers and designers, diving deep into various Flutter packages and APIs.\n\nInterestingly, I started my career path in civil engineering, graduating from Rajasthan Technical University, Kota, in 2021. However, my curiosity and love for problem-solving led me to pivot into software engineering. Since then, I’ve immersed myself in learning Java, data structures, and algorithms through various online courses and platforms.\n\nOne of my favorite pastimes is tackling challenges on LeetCode, where I’ve solved over 160 problems and actively participated in coding contests. This keeps my problem-solving skills sharp and my mind agile.\n\nI'm always eager to learn more, grow as a software engineer, and explore new opportunities. If you have an exciting project or simply want to connect, I'd love to hear from you!";
