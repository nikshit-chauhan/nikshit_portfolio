    "Hi, I'm Nikshit, a Flutter Developer at Sheegr Seafoods and Logistics, a company that provides sustainable and quality seafood products and services. I'm passionate about creating beautiful and functional mobile applications using Flutter and Firebase, and I have contributed to several projects for the company's clients and internal operations.\n Before joining Sheegr Seafoods, I worked as a Flutter Developer at UIPEP Technologies, a software development company that specializes in web and mobile solutions. There, I gained valuable experience in working with different Flutter packages and APIs, as well as collaborating with other developers and designers. I also have a background in civil engineering, having graduated from Rajasthan Technical University, Kota in 2021. I decided to switch careers and pursue my interest in software engineering, and I have been learning Java and data structures and algorithms through online courses and platforms. I enjoy solving problems and challenges on LeetCode, where I have solved over 160 problems and participated in coding contests. I'm eager to learn more and grow as a software engineer, and I'm always open to new opportunities and feedback.";
